I very much enjoyed playing CaH with my friends. However the long queues are very annoying. So i thought I'd just create my own one.
Now, i'm not that experienced so i just started this beta. I might not finish it. 
For the beta i plan to create it as a single players to figure out the methodes. After that, i'll figure out how to work with servers. Finaly i'll create a WPF-app and put those two things together. I'd like to document it here, so i can keep an overview. I'm not experienced with Github at all.
